## Introduction

This project demonstrates how to design and build an analog weighing scale using a load cell and an opamp-based amplification circuit. The load cell is a type of sensor that converts a force into an electrical signal. In this project, we use operational amplifiers to amplify the small electrical signals generated by the load cell for accurate weight measurement.

*Description of the circuit diagram:*
- Outputs of the load cell is connected to the pcb.
- Then output difference voltage connects to inputs of instrumentation amplifier circuit.
- The amplified signal is directly connects to the ADC of the microcontroller.

## Working Principle

1. **Load Cell**: The load cell deforms slightly when a force is applied, changing the resistance of strain gauges inside the cell.
2. **Wheatstone Bridge**: The load cell is wired in a Wheatstone bridge configuration, which outputs a small differential voltage proportional to the applied weight.
3. **Amplification**: The differential voltage from the load cell is very small, so it is amplified using an opamp-based differential amplifier circuit.For to be more precise and efficient we use a instrumentation amplifier circuit.
4. **Output**: The amplified signal can be read using an analog-to-digital converter (ADC), for this we use 12 bit ADC of the microcontroller.

## Setup and Installation

1. **Assemble the Circuit**: Follow the provided circuit diagram to connect the load cell, opamps, and other components.
2. **Power Up**: Connect the power supply to the circuit.
3. **Calibration**: Calibrate the load cell and amplifier circuit using known weights to ensure accuracy.
4. **Read Output**: Connect the output to an ADC if using a microcontroller, or read the output directly on an analog meter.

## Usage

1. **Place Weight**: Place the object to be weighed on the load cell.
2. **Read Measurement**: Observe the amplified signal on the analog meter or read the digital value from the microcontroller's display.
